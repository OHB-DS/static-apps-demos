    <h2>Oil Spill Spread Detection from Sentinel-2</h2>
        On 7 October 2018, the ferry vessel Ulysse collided with the container ship CSL Virginia north of Cape Corsica.<br><br> 
        The collision smashed a hole in the hull of the CSL Virginia.
        The breached tanks released upwards of 600 tonnes of heavy fuel oil into the Mediterranean Sea, causing a 4-km long spill.<br><br>

    <div class="text">
    While this event was captured with Sentinel-1 SAR 
    (<a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2018/10/Oil_spill_spread" target="blank">article from ESA</a>),
    here we demonstrate that the oil spill spread could also be observed from Sentinel-2 optical imagery.

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <div class="text">
        We first download the Sentinel-2 image covering the area of interest acquired on the 9th of October 2018.<br><br>
        There is little contrast over the water pixels and the oil spill is barely perceptible on this RGB image.

        <div class="caption">Figure 2: Oil spill spread shown on 9th October Sentinel-2 image (barely visible).</div>
    </center>
    <div class="text">
        Then we can look at each individual band to see which one provides the most contrast between oil and water.<br><br>
        In the figure below, we show the 4 bands from Sentinel-2 that come at 10m/pixel, namely the Blue, Green, Red and Near Infrared.<br><br>
        Although there is little variation of the reflectance values over water (about 0.05 range within the image), 
        we can see that the oil spill shows slightly higher reflectance than the surrounding pixels, especially for the Blue and Green bands.

        <div class="caption">Figure 3: Visualisation of individuals Sentinel-2 bands and their histograms.</div>
    </center>
    <div class="text">
        By combining the Blue, Green and Red bands, we can compute the <a href="https://custom-scripts.sentinel-hub.com/custom-scripts/sentinel-2/oil-spill-index/" target="blank">
        Oil Spill Index (OSI)</a>:<br>
        <div class="equation">OSI = (Green + Red)/Blue</div>
        In this case, the Red band seems to be affected by the swath of the sensor so we will just use the Blue band instead.
        In the plot below, the pixels that have a value above the 95th percentile are shown in red colours.

        <div class="caption">Figure 4: The Blue band provides the most contrast between the oil spill pixels and the surroundings.</div>
    </center>
    <div class="text">
        Next, we need to enhance the signal of the oil spill pixels. We can do this by applying image processing techniques that 
        reduce the background noise.<br><br>
        Here we apply a <a href="https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/filters/plot_tophat.html" target="blank">white top-hat filter</a> to highlight the "brighter" features
        on the image (i.e., oil spill pixels), and then we apply a Gaussian filter to blurr out the background noise.<br><br>
        The resulting image is shown below.

        <div class="caption">Figure 5: Image after applying a White Top-hat followed by a Gaussian filter.</div>
    </center>
    <div class="text">
        Finally, we can extract pixels with values above the 95th percentile to create an oil spill binary mask.<br><br>
        That's it, the oil spill is mapped! It can now be communicated to the responsible authorities!
